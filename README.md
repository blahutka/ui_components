# UiComponents

[Appica UI](https://appica.dev/ui) components for Rails, rendered with **Phlex 2**, styled with
Appica's **Tailwind v4** classes and made interactive with **Stimulus**. Previews run in **Lookbook**.

```ruby
class FrameworkPicker < Phlex::HTML
  include UI

  def view_template
    Autocomplete(items: [ "Next.js", "Remix", "Astro" ]) do
      AutocompleteInput(placeholder: "Search a framework")
      AutocompleteContent do
        AutocompleteEmpty { "No frameworks found." }
        AutocompleteList do |item|
          AutocompleteItem(value: item) { item }
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

From ERB: `<%= render FrameworkPicker.new %>`.

## Layout

Each component lives in its own folder with everything it needs:

```
app/components/ui/autocomplete/
  autocomplete.rb, autocomplete_input.rb, …   # UI::Autocomplete, UI::AutocompleteInput, …
  autocomplete_controller.js                   # Stimulus controller "ui--autocomplete"
  autocomplete.css                             # non-utility CSS
  autocomplete_preview.rb                      # Lookbook scenarios
```

The folders are collapsed for Zeitwerk (no extra namespace), served by Propshaft and pinned
by the engine's importmap (`ui/...`). `app/components/ui/index.js` registers the controllers,
`app/components/ui/index.css` imports the Appica tokens (`theme.css`) and each component's CSS.

## Host app setup

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "ui_components", path: "../ui_components"
```

```js
// app/javascript/application.js (after controllers/application exists)
import "ui"
```

```css
/* app/assets/tailwind/application.css — use the installed gem path (`bundle show ui_components`) */
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "<gem path>/app/components/ui/index.css";
@source "<gem path>/app/components";
```

## Development

```bash
bundle install
```

```bash
bin/rails test
```

### Running the dummy app (Lookbook)

`test/dummy` is a minimal Rails app that hosts the engine: Propshaft, Importmap + Stimulus,
Tailwind v4 (`tailwindcss-rails`) and Lookbook. It has no database, so there is nothing to migrate.

Start it from the engine root:

```bash
test/dummy/bin/dev
```

`bin/dev` builds Tailwind once (`bin/rails tailwindcss:build`), keeps a watcher running in the
background so class changes in `app/components/**/*.rb` are picked up, and starts Puma on port 3000.
The watcher stops when you stop the server with Ctrl-C.

Then open http://localhost:3000/lookbook (http://localhost:3000 redirects there).

Extra arguments go to `rails server`, so you can pick another port if 3000 is taken:

```bash
test/dummy/bin/dev -p 3047
```

To run the pieces separately, e.g. when using foreman with `test/dummy/Procfile.dev`:

```bash
cd test/dummy && bin/rails tailwindcss:build && bin/rails server
```

Notes:
- Previews live next to each component (`app/components/ui/<component>/*_preview.rb`) and reload on change.
- Use the **Theme** switcher in Lookbook's toolbar to preview dark mode; the preview layout is
  `test/dummy/app/views/layouts/component_preview.html.erb`.
- If styles look missing after adding new classes, check that the Tailwind watcher is running,
  or rebuild with `bin/rails tailwindcss:build` from `test/dummy`.
